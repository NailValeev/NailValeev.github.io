A static site is a collection of plain HTML pages. 
It is easy to create and edit these in any text editor / HTML editor / IDE, but managing of assets and repeated elements
is not convenient.

A content management system, `CMS`, i.e. WordPress, stores content in a database and provides administration tools
for editing and applying of themes - so, management becomes easier. 
But CMS has cons: performance / security isuues, limited possibilities for page layout customizing. 

A static site generator (`SSG`) is a compromise between using a static site and a CMS. 
It generates an HTML-only, e.g. static site using user-defined data (such as Markdown files) and templates.
[Static Site Generators][ssg-info] are suited to build fast websites that can handle a lot of content without relying on servers or databases.  
In this project I use [Jekyll][jekyll-docs], and it works out-of-the-box like a charm!
