A blog is nothing without its readers, and blog isn’t really a blog without comments, because a blogging is not just publishing of content, but also the two-way communication.  
The very first thing a blogger can do for his readers is to allow them to have their voice be heard if they choose to speak.
By the way, a lot of folks are mad about comment fights, let's give them a chance to enjoy!  
So, I decide to use [Disqus][disqus-info] as an effective comment controlling system to convert this site into a discussion community.  
The job was easy as pie, I just have create a `Disqus` account, register my site, save shortname in configuration file and embed one script to the post layout.

As they say in business, “Once a customer, always a customer”. With blogging, “Once an action taker, always an action taker.”

So, share this post if you agree! <br>
