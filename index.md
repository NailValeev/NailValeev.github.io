<h1>Are you a hammer or a nail?</h1>

Three years ago I have see the movie [Focus][focus-info] with Will Smith. I still remember this short, but important phrase. 
Of course I immediately thought, am I a hammer or a nail? I thought I’m a “Nägel mit Köpfen”. This is German and translated says “Nail with Head”. 
It means to do things right, straight and a 100%.   
Am I sure? No doubts! I am a Nail - my name is Nail. And, definetly, I have a head, because I am student at LNU.
